A positive, driven person looking for the most elegant solutions to complex problems. I am a technologist, a futurist and a humanist. I’m passionate about product development, world-class user experience, disruptive innovation and software-eating-the-world. I am a trained Computer Scientist that loves building world-class Products. I have founded Nomad River and have led Product & Engineering teams at *Farfetch*, *Skyscanner*, Tourism and Smart Cities at *Ubiwhere*, and before that I worked as a Junior Programmer at *Wit Software*.
